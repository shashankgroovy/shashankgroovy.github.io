Hg - Mercurial
It is a completely different version control system.
I haven't had a chance to exprience much with mercurial but over the course of
next 3 months I will be seeing heavy usage of it.
### Why?
Since the GNU CLISP project is backed on a mercurial repository.

Solution:
--------

I came across: [Hg-prompt](http://stevelosh.com/projects/hg-prompt/).
It is used to display repository information and built by **Steve Losh**
himself.
