Hi there.

I am Shashank Srivastav, a cool, mischievous programmer and person.
Or that's what people say about me :)
And I love to build things for the web and delve myself in programming.

I love to read (comics :P), listen to some post, ambient or indie Rock
music and play pranks. My life interests revolve around various channels:

* On the mind front : programming, science
* On the heartfelt roads: painting, travelling, photography *(shh! I still have to
get better at this!)* 
* And a couple of more.

This blog is my little corner of the internet wherein I post random thoughts,
ideas and various other things that interest me.

> In the depths of internet these are my monikers:

> * Hacker name : fnaticshank
* IRC nicks : paphos, kr0n0s.

*FYI, [fnatic]('http://www.fnatic.com/') is a famous gaming team.*


###  Aim -  "Survive a Zombie War"

You know program some robots to do my laundry while I save the world ;)

### Bragging rights
Still working on this. None attained yet.
