Lets learn how to work with torrents and get you up and running

And we'll keep the jargon for later.

Now there are only 4 steps in this process:

1. Open a torrent client
2. Visit a torrent hosting website
3. Download a torrent file or torrent magnet link
4. Enjoy.


Torrent Client
--------------

A torrent client is a software which we use to download the contents off the
web and the location of those contents is available by a torrent file.

Lets download a torrent client for ourselves now.
Head over to [utorrent.com](http://www.utorrent.com/) to download the latest
stable version. You don't want to go for the pro version.

> Note: Since I have a different operating system. the page shows `Free download
> for Linux`. What you'll see is `Free download for Windows`.

Or you can simply go to this page directly and [download for windows](http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/win)

> *Still having troubles? [Just click
here](http://download-new.utorrent.com/endpoint/utorrent/os/windows/track/stable/)*

Your download should have been started. After that simply install using the
uTorrent.exe file you just downloaded. Moving on!

Torrent Hosting Website
------------------------

A torrent hosting website as the name says hosts all the torrent files i.e.
this is where you'll find all the torrents file with which you can download
movies, songs, softwares, games etc.

FYI before proceeding I should warn you that using torrents is illegal in some
parts of the world but here you don't have to care about anything. So
use it all you want. :)

With that out of the way, we can focus on the torrent website.
[Kickass Torrents](https://kickass.so/) is a fantastic place to serve all your
torrent needs. You can go there a find links to everything you might want
(movies, tvshows, cartoons etc.).

Next step: Search for your movie.
For example, Frankeistein

So far so good. We have a torrent client (uTorrent) and we know about torrent
hosting website (KickAss Torrents). That's a good progress now. Let's learn
about torrent files now.

Torrent Files or Magnet Links
-----------------------------

You must be wondering, "Wait what you have a slight idea about torrent files
but what is this magnetic link?". Answer to that we'll find out soon.

There are 2 ways to download content via torrents:

1. Torrent files
2. Magnet links *(better and recommended)*

A [Torrent file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file) is a file which
contains information about the files/content/movies you want to download. And that's
pretty much it.

So what's a Magnetic link? 
A magnet link or a magnetic link is the information itself which a torrent file
holds.

Say what? okay lets look at it this way when you click on Download torrent
file, it downloads a small file on your computer. This file tells your torrent
client(uTorrent) about the content you want to download. Whereas magnet link
doesn't download any file it just loads that information and all you have to do
it click OK.

> And that's it you don't have to do anything. No files are saved with magnet
links, no nothing. Simply click on magnet link and voila! your utorrent will
open up. So easy right?

Yes, so from now on you should **always use magnet links**.

### Choosing good a torrent

Now comes the part of choosing good torrent files i.e. which have good high
quality content. For example, in the case of movies you might want a movie
which is of high quality but still be of low size.
    
![Torrent file](/images/abt-5.png)

Always watch in 720p BrRip quality (its good quality) and look for smaller file
sizes.  The lesser the size the time taken to download will be less.

Introducing 720p BrRip files which are high quality and range in size less than
1 GB. If you see closely the top link in our Frankeistein search result is a
720p BrRip file and on the right you can see the size as 751.5 MB.
Looks like a good torrent? Maybe.

Characteristics of a good torrent:

1. Many Comments (684 in our case)
*(so you can always look for comments)*
2. High Number of Seed and Leech.
*(Look at the farthest corner you'll see 1034 seeds, and 96 leachs)*

What are seeds and leachs? Lets skip for now. All you need to remember is if
they are high then its a good torrent. *(FYI that means how many people have
downloaded the torrent.)*


And phew! that's all of it! Thankyou for reading :)

Any questions? You can always call me up!
