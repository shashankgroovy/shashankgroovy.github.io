"Curiosity. That's the word"
----------------------------

> *(I have written this post from a third person perspective.)*

As Wikipedia states - The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual
program, first held from May to August 2005, in which Google awards stipends
(of USD 5,500 i.e. approx. INR 3,30,000) to all students who successfully
complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the
summer.

Over a thousand students get selected in GSoc every year from around the world
to work on projects and code their summer with free and open source software
organizations. And quite a lot of Indian students get selected. Upon being
asked about his achievement and getting a chance to work with awesome
developers Shashank replies with alacrity, "Its a relatively simple mix of
curiousity, learning and hardwork."

Getting selected into GSoC is simple and difficult at the same time. One needs
to have a sound knowledge and understanding of technologies, programming
concepts and languages. "The beauty of being able to talk with a machine is
fascinating. And for that you need to know how to program."

"Inspired by great developers and gadgets I knew how to program when I entered
college but not until I started taking computer courses did I get serious about
learning more about computers. While the curriculum covered only one computer
course per semester this was certainly not enough. So I on my own digged deeper
and started polishing my existing knowledge about making web applications."

"And It was during the first semester itself (in 2011) that the world's first
MOOC (read: Massive Open Online Class) was kicked off by Stanford's Professor
Sebastian Thrun on Artificial Intelligence. I was a part of that class. That is
what I consider a changing point in my life.", he says.


## What made the difference?

Marking his excerpt he elegantly tells, "Its like there's a red pill and a blue
pill. And you can take the blue pill and go back to your classroom and continue
to learn what's part of the curriculum, get good marks and pass with a degree.
But I took the red pill and I've seen curiosity, knowledge and logic flowing
all over. That's what makes great people.  I learn everyday. I continue to take
several online courses from both coursera and udacity.  And it has expanded my
mind about learning and helped me get better in programming too."

"Another pioneering event that motivated me to work harder was when I attended
the 'Python Conference India 2013'(read: Pycon) during August '13 in Bangalore.
And I got a chance to meet numerous awesome people who were working on creating
even amazing products. It is by meeting all these smart people that I realized
that life is all about building stuff which can bring a change in world and
people's life."

"Thus I worked a little more and finally when GSoC came I applied and got in.
And now that I am in, I have so much more to learn which is good. So a tip to
others who want to excel: Don't just stick to your curriculum, Learn more."

And finally Shashank concludes his thoughts by notifying that here are only 3 things important
in life:
> - Finding opportunuities - they look a lot like hardwork


> - Being smart - be really smart, and thoughful and generous

> - Building a life - Steve jobs said, 'Everything around us that we call life was
made up by people who are no smarter than you. You can build
your life where other people can live in. So build a life.'
So getting to GSoC is fairly simple. Its about committing to learn and grow
everyday that matters.


That's all Folks!
