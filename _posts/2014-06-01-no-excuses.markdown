The point is, that you can and should teach yourself some new skills. You’re
way closer to being employable than I was, that’s for sure. It may take some
evenings and weekends, but they’ll be some of the most fun evening and
weekends you ever have. Find something that you want to do and build it. Fall
in love with the idea, but be ready to dump it for something better.
